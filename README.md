# Nairobi Hospital Hypothyroidism Test

## 1. Defining the Question
### a) Specifying the Question

To build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid

### b) Defining the Metric for Success

To get a model that can have the highest level of prediction of above 90%

### c) Understanding the context

Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.

Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease.

Accurate thyroid function tests are available to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is usually simple, safe and effective once you and your doctor find the right dose for you.

Hypothyroidism signs and symptoms may include:

* Fatigue
* Increased sensitivity to cold
* Constipation
* Dry skin
* Weight gain
* Puffy face
* Hoarseness
* Muscle weakness
* Elevated blood cholesterol level
* Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness
* Pain, stiffness or swelling in your joints
* Heavier than normal or irregular menstrual periods
* Thinning hair
* Slowed heart rate
* Depression
* Impaired memory
* Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter)

### d). Recording the Experimental Design

We will use exploratory data analysis, such as Univariate, Bivariate, in this study to determine the relationships and differences between different variables. 
We shall also use Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine to make predictions.
